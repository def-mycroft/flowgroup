# Morphism — Documentation-First Vism

## Input

- requirement to define a vism as smallest developer object in MFME
    
- doctrine: documentation is always written before code
    
- vism described by executable arrow: explicit input → output contract
    
- surfaces: importable module + runnable CLI
    
- carries spec, properties, telemetry, and emits docs automatically
    

## Output (Essence)

- vism is a **documentation-first, self-describing unit of transformation**
    
- doc is canonical: contract, invariants, failures written before code
    
- core remains pure; adapters isolate side effects at edges
    
- telemetry enforces lineage; properties enforce truth
    
- scale emerges via composition; docs ensure invariants travel intact
    

## Invariants

- every vism defines one explicit **input → output** arrow
    
- spec, invariants, and failure modes must exist in documentation **before code**
    
- adapters isolate all IO and environment; core is deterministic
    
- telemetry spans emitted for receipts and lineage
    
- vism emits its own docs via `--document` flag
    

## Failure Modes

- **empty_input**: no valid input given
    
- **spec_absent**: implementation attempted before docs exist
    
- **broken_invariant**: property checks fail
    
- **adapter_leak**: side effects bleed into core
    
- **trace_loss**: telemetry missing or receipts absent
    
- **drift**: spec and implementation diverge
    

## Next Arrows

- codify doc-first practice into reusable scaffolds
    
- expand vism library into invariant net with canonical briefs
    
- compose visms into resilient pipelines, docs binding the joins
    
- scaffold AI agents that generate visms from briefs first
    
- integrate doc outputs into vault workflows for continuity

Would you like me to also generate the **Obsidian-ready Markdown doc template** for this doc-first vism (so you can drop it into your vault and use it as the canonical starting point each time)?
