# Agents Directory

Welcome to the space for Breathing Willow's individual agents. Anything that behaves like a script or module can live here.

Agents might be simple utilities, quick prototypes, or flow-friendly nodes. The idea is to keep them small and composable while we shape the project.

Please experiment freely. This folder will evolve as we discover how best to connect our tools and build flexible pipelines.
