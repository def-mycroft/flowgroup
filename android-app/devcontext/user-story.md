a typical use case - i go hiking. while i'm hiking, i'll have sms and gps connection most of the time. while hiking, i put in my friend's phone number, and my friend gets a google maps pin every n minutes while I have that set to active. i like to be able to test it via convenient "ping self now" button as well as feasibility of pinging myself every 1 minutes (test config that can be set up). note that recipientes should receive timestamp in my local time wherever I am (along with gps coords and google maps link).
