# User story — thorough description

You launch Android Studio, build, and open the app. On the main screen there’s no obvious affordance for configuring location pings; nothing on the home surface hints at where to set up recipients, interval, or a “Test now.” After a bit of hunting you discover the feature lives under Settings. The “Location Ping” entry doesn’t read like a first-class feature header, so it’s easy to miss. Inside, you can type phone numbers, but the field gives no guidance about E.164 formatting and there’s no contact assist; the input accepts raw text and leaves you unsure whether you’ve done it “right.” You enter two numbers, leave the default 15-minute interval, toggle pings on, and tap “Test now” to send a one-shot message. Instead of an SMS arriving, the UI shows a neutral status that literally says “no_location.” There’s no permission prompt, no hint whether GPS is disabled or timing out, no actionable copy, and no history view or receipt that confirms what the app attempted. From a user’s perspective, the feature is discoverable only by spelunking Settings, the inputs feel brittle, and the test action fails silently in terms of outcomes—you don’t know if it’s a permissions issue, a provider issue, or a bug in the location acquisition path.

# Redrafted story — MFME + agent-system context

The object here is “Location Ping” (PingNow): a user wants to configure and verify periodic SMS location pings from the app, then trust that a one-tap “Test now” will send a Google Maps link with a UTC timestamp to one or more recipients. In an MFME frame the arrow is simple: user intent and config (recipients, interval, enable) flow through a permission-gated location fix and an SMS send, yielding both an on-device message and a typed Receipt; every attempt should leave audit-grade breadcrumbs. The current build makes the feature feel hidden—discoverable under Settings but not expressed as a first-class feature entry—and when “Test now” is tapped without a valid fix, the user gets a bare “no_location” state without guidance, prompts, or a Receipt they can inspect. Inputs accept arbitrary text for phone numbers with no soft validation or contact picker, which adds needless uncertainty before the core path even works.

Expected behavior in this doctrine is crisp. The main surface should advertise a clear route to “Location Ping,” or the Settings section should be visually distinct with a one-line subtitle that names the promise (“Send your current location by SMS on a schedule or on demand”). First use must be permission-gated: if SEND_SMS or location permissions are missing, request them inline before attempting work; if location services are off or providers are restricted, surface a one-tap intent to enable; if battery optimization would suppress periodic sends, say so and link to the system panel. A one-shot “Test now” should synchronously try a one-fix location with a short, visible spinner; success results in an SMS to all recipients with a Google Maps link and UTC timestamp; failure results in helpful copy that names the cause (permissions denied, providers off, timeout) and still emits a typed Receipt so the History/Receipts pane shows what happened. All timestamps and logs remain UTC; duplicates collapse by stable keys; there’s no cloud egress in the capture path.

Given the broader agent-system, the conductor keeps “Location Ping” as the active object and binds roles accordingly: Yuē sets the minimum constraints (permissions first, UTC discipline, idempotent receipts, no main-thread I/O), Héng keeps the cadence healthy (WorkManager schedule honored, battery-optimization warning up front, periodic receipts visible), and Fù ensures each attempt writes a deterministic Receipt and a short operator note so later cycles are easier to diagnose. The immediate scope stays small—fix the permission and location-acquisition path and make “Test now” reliable and self-explanatory—while soft number validation and contact-picker assist land as follow-ons once the core arrow is proven. In short: make the feature first-class and self-diagnosing, ensure every tap yields either an SMS or an actionable, receipt-backed reason, and keep everything local-first with UTC receipts so the experience feels trustworthy even when a fix can’t be acquired.
