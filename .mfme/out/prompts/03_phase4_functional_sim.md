# Prompt 03 â€” Phase-4 Functional Simulation Prep

**Objective**: Chart the remaining blockers between the current sushi kernel and a full Phase-4 functional simulation.

**Tasks**
1. Inventory outstanding integration points across agents, android surfaces, and back-end cadence loops.
2. Score each blocker by risk, reversible effort, and dependency depth.
3. Nominate preview-lane validation experiments that keep the kernel internal/unsafe.

**Success Criteria**
- Artifact summarizing blockers stored in `.mfme/out/artifacts/` with owner assignments.
- Receipts capture prioritization rationale and suggested experiment order.
- Debrief updated with 10-minute validation steps for each high-risk item.
