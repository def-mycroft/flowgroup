# How to Use Tide

*Tide* is an evolving platform for shaping AI-driven workflows. It brings together chat-based interactions, code snippets, and a vibe-first mindset so you can experiment with automation in a playful way.

Using Tide is simple. Here are three patterns to get you started:

1. **Vibe Coding** – you might say, "`tide run vibe-code`" to kick off a session where you tinker with code and see how the system adapts. It's a casual way to try ideas quickly.
2. **Shaping Conversations** – you might say, "`tide flow shape-this-convo`" when you want to steer the chat in a certain direction. Tide listens and adjusts the context as you go.
3. **Managing Agents** – you might say, "`tide agent status`" or "`tide agent tune`" to check in on your agents or tweak their behavior. Tide gives you the tools to keep everything humming.

Behind the scenes, Tide keeps track of a *shaping target*. That's the goal you're aiming for, and Tide surfaces it so you always know where you're headed. The more you interact, the clearer the target becomes.

Have fun! Every command shapes Tide a bit more, so you're constantly refining the experience as you use it.
